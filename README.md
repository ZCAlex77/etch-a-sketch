### Description
A small app that lets you draw by simply hovering the mouse over the canvas. I made this app following a lesson on theodinproject.com about DOM manipulation.
### What I learned from this?
- how to style a range input
- how to use data attributes
- how to rotate elements with transform (note: it's more about sizing the rotated elements properly; I faced this problem while trying to rotate the range input and couldn't change the width because it added horizontal space too which was unwanted; I kind of solved it by placing the input into a div and rotating the div instead)
### Features
- input for changing the color
- eraser tool to clear cells you're hovering above
- clear button to clear the entire canvas
- rainbow mode (color changes for each cell you're painting)
- slide for changing the canvas size
